## R Code

### Data loading and exploratory analysis

The following code snippets follow the post above. For this simple example I'll use the **Managers** data set in the **Performance Analytics** package. 

{% highlight r %}
#The data sets looks like this
head(managers)
{% endhighlight %}

```ruby
int
gem install
x = rnorm(1000) 
```
